        <h1>Camp Wabashi Registration Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>To ensure the comfort, safety, and overall experience of all campers, the Board of Directors has established the following policy regarding camp registration and bunk allocation.</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Camp Capacity & Accommodations</h2>
        <p>Over recent years, the camp has faced instances where the number of campers exceeded the available bunks in the cabins. To accommodate these excess campers, temporary sleeping arrangements were made by sectioning off areas of the loft and placing mattresses on the floor. While we strived to make these accommodations suitable, it has been determined that these arrangements detract from the true Camp Wabashi experience, particularly the traditional cabin living and access to limited shower facilities. Additionally, these temporary arrangements reduced space in the game room during a time when it was most needed by campers.</p>

        <h2>2. Registration Policy</h2>
        <p>In light of these challenges, the Board of Directors has resolved to enforce a strict policy that prevents registration beyond our available bunk capacity. The following procedures will apply:</p>

        <h2>3. Pre-Registration Requirements</h2>
        <p>To reserve a bunk for a specific week, campers must pre-register by submitting a completed application and a non-refundable registration fee of $10.00. Applications must be received by June 1st. All applications should be sent to:</p>
        <p class="highlight">Camp Wabashi, 3525 E. Harlan Dr., Terre Haute, IN 47802</p>

        <h2>4. Reservation Confirmation</h2>
        <p>The Camp Manager will assign a number to each application based on the order of receipt, and will continue accepting registrations until all bunks are filled. Campers who successfully secure a bunk will receive a guarantee for their spot until 5:00 p.m. on the first day of camp registration. Should a camper be delayed, they must notify the Camp Director in advance to hold their bunk.</p>

        <h2>5. Waiting List & Cancellations</h2>
        <p>Should the bunks be fully reserved, applicants will be placed on a waiting list. If any cancellations occur, the Camp Manager will notify individuals on the waiting list in the order their applications were received. Those notified will have the opportunity to reserve any available bunks.</p>

        <h2>6. No-Show & Late Arrival Policy</h2>
        <p>Any campers who have reserved a bunk and do not check in between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Sunday (the designated registration time) and fail to notify the Camp Director of a late arrival, will forfeit their reserved bunk. In such cases, the reserved bunk will be offered first to campers on the waiting list and then to walk-in campers on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

        <h2>7. Check-In and Check-Out Times</h2>
        <p>Campers should plan to arrive between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Sunday for check-in. This period allows staff traveling from out of town to settle in and conduct necessary meetings before campers' arrival. Pick-up time is scheduled for between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. on the following Saturday.</p>

        <p>We appreciate your understanding of these necessary changes and look forward to welcoming all of you to Camp Wabashi this summer.</p>
