Syxton CMS
=========

This is my little pet project I built for my local summer camp for their website / event registration / anything else they want. <http://www.campwabashi.org>

Development is driven entirely by the next "thing it needs to do" and I use it mostly to keep my coding skills refined and to test new concepts.

It began as an entirely AJAX driven site, but that was when it was just a testbed for my AJAX learning.

It's features include (but are not limited to):

 - Roles and permission structure functioning on the following hierarchy
	 - ROLE ON PAGE
		 - GROUP MEMBERSHIP
			 - SPECIFIC USER
				 - ROLE ON SPECIFIC MODULE
					 - GROUP ON MODULE
						 - SPECIFIC USER ON SPECIFIC MODULE
	 - 80/20 page layout with blocks on right side
	 - Rotating carousel of images and quotes
	 - Entirely DB driven
	 - Synchronous location reservation discussions and votes
	 - File Manager for each user
	 - Event staff application and approval process with background check tracker / communication tools
	 - Features that can be on either main area or block
		 - Calendar
		 - HTML area
		 - Polling
		 - Custom Donation drives with real-time progress tracking
		 - Full featured Forums/Shoutbox
		 - Asynchronous Chat
		 - Events with registration and payment
		 - News feed
		 - Image gallery
